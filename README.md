<strong>Assignment 8: </strong>Simulating a Pipelined Processor

In this assignment you will extend the simulator you wrote in Assignment 7 by introducing <strong>PIPELINING</strong> into the processor.

<ol>

 <li>Use the pipelining structure and ideas for the MIPS processor we studied in class.</li>

 <li>Stall the processor when any type of hazard is detected.</li>

 <li>In your output, display the instruction that is active in each stage of the pipeline (in addition to the information you displayed in Assignment 7).</li>

</ol>

Other details of the simulation, input program, output display, etc., are as stated in Assignment
